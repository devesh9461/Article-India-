                From the theoretical musings of Alan Turing to the tangible reality of large language models that can write poetry and code, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has journeyed from science fiction to a foundational technology of our modern world. We stand at a pivotal moment, an inflection point where the progress of the next decade could dwarf everything that has come before. The future of AI is no longer a question of <em>if</em>, but of <em>how</em> it will reshape our reality.
